# Spotify Song Popularity Analysis
In this project I used a dataset consisting of the top Spotify songs from 2010 to 2019 and a variety of characteristics for each. Using this data, the goal was to predict the popularity of a given song using the characteristics of said song. Those specific characteristics can be found in a chart in the PDF of the project. I started by using various regression models but the predictions of the data were centered too close to average. I then made popularity a categorical variable and attempted to use classification models to make the predictions. While the accuracy appeared higher here, it was simply due to the larger categories created by making popularity categorical. The predictions were still rather centered around the average. In the end, with the methods used one would be able to pretty accurately predict the overall level of popularity, but not the spcific popularity rating. 

In several locations you will see code commented out. I did not have the RAM required to run several of the classification models. In response a professor aided me in running them and sent the output. The code is all mine, it was simply run by an outside source.
